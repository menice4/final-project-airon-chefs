## Problem Statement

In a world where face-to-face interactions have been replaced by screen-to-screen communication, staying connected with friends, family, and colleagues has become more challenging. Traditional quiz games often lack a truly interactive, real-time multiplayer experience, making learning and competition feel isolated rather than engaging. There is a need for a fun yet educational platform that not only encourages friendly competition but also reinforces knowledge in a way that feels engaging and rewarding.

---

## Solution

Our solution is a fun, lightweight trivia-based party game that allows players to compete in real time across a variety of knowledge categories. Whether you're testing your trivia skills solo or challenging friends, the game offers an engaging way to compete, track scores, and climb the leaderboard—all while making learning fun and interactive.

With single-player and multiplayer modes, users can either challenge themselves individually or compete with friends, making learning engaging, competitive, and social. By combining education with entertainment, this app brings people together—proving once and for all who has what it takes to win while fostering a culture of continuous learning.

## Challenges & Learnings

Over the course of the week, we solidified core technical skills such as working with APIs, deploying both front-end and back-end, testing, DevOps, and authentication. We also honed essential soft skills like pair programming, teamwork, and agile methodology. Additionally, we gained experience with a new technology: Socket.io.

As a team, we faced challenges with CSS styling, navigating WebSockets, and implementing authentication with Supabase. Another significant hurdle was merge conflicts, which slowed down our workflow. Moving forward, we would ensure regular git pull updates to minimise conflicts and take extra care with file naming conventions to improve collaboration.

## Future Improvements


💡 AI-powered quiz generation – Enable users to provide context to OpenAI alongside API responses to create custom quizzes.
💡 Expanded test coverage – Improve unit testing for the backend, focusing on API integration and simulating WebSocket behaviour.
💡 Persistent high scores – Allow users to save their scores and return later to beat their personal bests.
